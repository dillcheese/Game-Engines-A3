# Game-Engines-A3

My game project will be a simple platformer game, where the player has to jump to different platforms in order to reach the end. To ensure this game is within scope for this assignment I'm making it with minimal features in mind. The features included in this game will be player movement (with WASD), jumping (with spacebar), collision, gravity and some animated color changing textures/materials. I also added a shooting mechanic (with E key) to demonstrate the object pool and a bonus objective that can only be obtained with shooting.

THIRD PARTY SOURCES:

The 3rd party sources I used were the ones from this class. Specifically the lab where the TA taught us how to make and the object pool in Unity.
